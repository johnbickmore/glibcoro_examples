This repo contains examples of the use of **glibcoro**
([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ldo/glibcoro),
[GitHub](https://github.com/ldo/glibcoro)), my module which makes the
GLib/GTK+ event loop compatible with Pythonâ€™s
[`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) framework.

`animsort` -- this is a GUI-based app that produces a simple demonstration
of various sorting algorithms. I first wrote it many years ago, as an
exercise in learning GTK+. This version runs the sorting algorithm in a
coroutine, concurrently with updating the user interface.

`rocket_launch` -- this is a simple rocket-launch simulator, which prints
out a sequence of text messages indicating the progress of a launch: a
five-second countdown, followed by liftoff, followed by booster separation,
followed by achieving orbit. For added flavour, the program runs three
launches, starting at different times and overlapping their sequences,
to demonstrate event-loop-friendliness.

The `rocket_launch` example can work with either the `glibcoro` event
loop or the standard one provided by `asyncio`; this is controlled by
the environment variable USE_GLIB that you set before invoking the
script -- see the source for details.
